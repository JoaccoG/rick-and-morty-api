# Bootcamp Challenge - Week 4, Frontend CRUD App.

## Rick and Morty API.

Choose a public API from where you want to retrieve data.<br>
You will have to create a CRUD application using the public API. The application should have a listing page, a details page, and a form to create, read, update, and delete data.<br>
This are the minimum requirements to start working on the challenge.

- Trello backlog.
- Figma design (375px and 1440px frames).
- When building the figma design, keep in mind:
  - The need of a complete CRUD.
  - User feedback along the app usage.
  - Pagination of data.
  - Details page.

### Requirements.

- React (Flux architecture pattern).
- React-Router-Dom.
- TypeScript.
- Jest testing (w/React-Testing-Library).
- SonarCloud code analysis (and code coverage at a minimum of 80%).
- JSON Server (through render web services).
- Netlify deploy.
- Husky (git hooks).
- BEM Methodology.
- CI/CD Pipelines through GitHub Actions.
- Protect main branch:
  - Can't push without pull request.
  - Can't push if pipelines checks haven't passed.
